# Time-locked Operations

## Project Description
Create operations that execute after delay periods. This smart contract enables users to lock their tokens for a specified duration, ensuring that funds cannot be accessed until the predetermined time period has elapsed. This mechanism is commonly used for vesting schedules, savings plans, and security measures in decentralized applications.

## Project Vision
To provide a secure and transparent time-locking mechanism on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to:
- Implement delayed execution of financial operations
- Create trustless vesting and savings solutions
- Enhance security through temporal restrictions
- Build foundation for complex DeFi protocols requiring time-based constraints

Our vision is to make time-locked operations accessible, secure, and user-friendly while maintaining the decentralized principles of blockchain technology.
